# Airbnb-Paris-Analysis
Paris Airbnb Data Analysis 🏠📊

Welcome to the Paris Airbnb Data Analysis repository! This project dives into an extensive dataset of over 250,000 Airbnb listings and 5 million guest reviews in Paris. The analysis uncovers pricing trends, evaluates neighborhood differences, and investigates the impact of regulatory changes on new hosts.

**Day 8 - 100 Days of Coding Challenge by Noah Khomer** 🚀

## Project Overview 🌟

This project represents Day 8 of my 100 Days of Coding challenge, showcasing the power of data analysis and the fascinating insights hidden within real-world datasets. The analysis has been transformed into a beautiful, interactive web frontend that presents the findings in an engaging and professional manner.

## Project Goals 🎯

The objective of this project was to:

- Analyze Airbnb listings in Paris to uncover trends
- Evaluate neighborhood-level pricing and accommodation differences
- Assess the impact of 2015 regulations on new hosts and pricing
- Create a stunning web presentation of the analysis results

## Dataset Details 📂

**Source:** Airbnb Open Data

- **Listings.csv:** ~154MB, 250,000+ listings with details on hosts, neighborhoods, prices, and accommodations
- **Reviews.csv:** 5 million guest reviews for in-depth analysis of user experiences

## Key Features 🔑

### Data Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** Filtered for Paris-specific data and handled missing values
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated metrics (min, max, and average prices) grouped by neighborhood, host years, and accommodation types
- **Visualization:** Bar charts, line charts, and dual-axis graphs built with Matplotlib

### Frontend Features
- **Modern Design:** Sleek, dark-themed interface with glass-morphism effects
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for all device sizes
- **Interactive Elements:** Smooth scrolling, hover effects, and scroll-triggered animations
- **Professional Presentation:** Beautiful cards, gradients, and typography

## Key Insights 📈

- **Regulatory Impact:** A sharp decline in new Airbnb hosts post-2015 regulations
- **Neighborhood Pricing:** Élysée commands the highest prices, while other neighborhoods remain more affordable
- **Accommodation Size:** Larger accommodations drive higher prices, particularly in premium areas
- **Market Trends:** Pricing fluctuations have stabilized in recent years

## Tools and Libraries 🛠️

### Backend Analysis
- **Python**
- **Pandas:** Data cleaning and manipulation
- **Matplotlib:** Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Code execution and analysis

### Frontend Development
- **HTML5:** Semantic structure and content
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid development
- **JavaScript:** Interactive features and smooth animations
- **Font Awesome:** Professional icons and visual elements

## Visualizations 🖼️

The project includes comprehensive data visualizations generated using Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) and imported directly into the frontend:

- **Bar Chart:** Average prices by neighborhood
- **Line Chart:** New host trends over time, showing the regulatory impact
- **Dual-Axis Chart:** Comparing the number of new hosts and average prices year-over-year
- **Accommodation Analysis:** Price vs. accommodation capacity relationships
- **Market Overview:** Comprehensive market insights and trends

## Challenges Faced 🐛

### Data Processing
- **Data Encoding:** Resolved UnicodeDecodeError by specifying the correct encoding format in pd.read_csv()
- **Large Dataset:** Efficiently handled large data files using optimized Pandas operations

### Frontend Development
- **Design Consistency:** Created a cohesive, professional theme throughout the interface
- **Performance Optimization:** Implemented smooth animations and responsive design
- **User Experience:** Ensured intuitive navigation and engaging visual presentation

## Frontend Sections 📱

The web interface includes:

1. **Hero Section:** Project overview with animated statistics
2. **Project Objectives:** Clear goals and analysis focus areas
3. **Key Insights:** Detailed findings with visual cards
4. **Analysis Process:** Step-by-step methodology explanation
5. **Data Visualizations:** Interactive gallery of charts and graphs
6. **Python Code:** Technical implementation showcase
7. **Challenges & Solutions:** Problem-solving documentation
8. **Future Enhancements:** Planned improvements and next steps
9. **Project Reflection:** Personal learnings and insights

## Next Steps 🔮
